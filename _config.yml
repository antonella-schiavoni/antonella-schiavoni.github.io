  Hello👋 my name is Antonella Schiavoni, I’m a Senior Machine Learning Engineer with over 5 years of experience. I am currently working at ASAPP as Machine Learning Engineer in the NLP Modeling team and also working on my Data Sciente Master thesis.
  I enjoy learning new things and building prototypes to apply the knowledge. I work with Python and a wide range of ML frameworks and libraries. I am always looking for opportunities to learn and apply something new.
  The technologies that I currently have the most experience working with are: Python, Pytorch, Docker, Kubernetes, R, Sklearn, Pandas, Git, AWS services.
