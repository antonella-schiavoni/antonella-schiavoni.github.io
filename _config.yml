  Hello👋 my name is Antonella Schiavoni, I’m a Senior Machine Learning Engineer with over 5 years of experience. I am currently working at ASAPP as Machine Learning Engineer in the NLP Modeling team and also working on my Data Sciente Master thesis.
  I enjoy learning new things and building prototypes to apply the knowledge 🤓. I work with Python 🐍 and a wide range of ML frameworks and libraries. I am always looking for opportunities to learn and apply something new.
  The technologies that I currently have the most experience working with are: Python, Pytorch, Docker, Kubernetes, Circle CI, Jenkins, R, Sklearn, Pandas, Git, ML Flow and AWS services.

          • Deploy and monitor new ML model services into production.
          • Build and maintain airflow pipelines for training machine learning models.
          • Improve deployment pipelines. This involved the migration of our deployment scripts to a full easy-to-use pipeline using lanzar and spinnaker.
          • Ownership over one of the most important services that summarizes conversations.
          • Train and maintain Asapp’s customer machine learning models which also involved the computation of model metrics to evaluate model performance, and the creation of custom monitors in Datadog.
          • Perform data analysis on model’s results to evaluate ab test performance.
          • Launch new clients to Asapp’s ML platform.
          • Technical and Cultural Fit Interviewer
          • Adapt service and model to run using GPU workers in production
          • Decouple service to be used separated from ASAPP product. This involves the design and implementation of a public API
          • Promoted to Senior Machine Learning in November 2021

          • Analyse and confirm the integrity of source data to be evaluated.
          • Generate reports following quality control procedures to document analysis and model findings.
          • Collaborate in the elaboration of complex data structures and programs.
          • Create documentation, specifications, diagrams, and charts to provide direction to business and other IT teams.
          • Perform data analysis and data modeling to create source to target mappings.
          • Feature engineering. Use of Machine learning algorithms to create new variables.
          • Analyse structured and unstructured data.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          During my masters at Universidad de San Andres I worked on improving my analytical skills as well as my modeling and statistical skils. I had the opportunity to study and apply a wide variety of machine learning techniques, as well as learning and understanding the mathematical background beahind this algorithims. In the two year program I've improve my knowlgede on statistics, programming for data analysis, data visualization, supervised and unsupervised networs, NLP, neural networks with an image processing approach, and geostatistics and graph networks.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
