  Helloüëã my name is Antonella Schiavoni, I‚Äôm a Senior Machine Learning Engineer with over 5 years of experience. I am currently working at ASAPP as Machine Learning Engineer in the NLP Modeling team and also working on my Data Sciente Master thesis.
  I enjoy learning new things and building prototypes to apply the knowledge ü§ì. I work with Python üêç and a wide range of ML frameworks and libraries. I am always looking for opportunities to learn and apply something new.
  The technologies that I currently have the most experience working with are: Python, Pytorch, Docker, Kubernetes, Circle CI, Jenkins, R, Sklearn, Pandas, Git, ML Flow and AWS services.

          During my masters at Universidad de San Andres I worked on improving my analytical skills as well as my modeling and statistical skills. I had the opportunity to study and apply a wide variety of machine learning techniques, as well as learning and understanding the mathematical background beahind the algorithims. In the two years program, I've improve my knowlgede on statistics, programming for data analysis, data visualization, supervised and unsupervised networs, NLP, neural networks with an image processing approach, and geostatistics and graph networks.
